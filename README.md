# Karmic-Debt-Calculator
This Unity Project lets you determine your prospective years in which karmic debt will play a role in your life. Years that fall under the karmic value of 13,14,16, and 19 are karmic debt years.  This was meant to simulate how name selection could be just as pivotal of a factor in character growth.Â
